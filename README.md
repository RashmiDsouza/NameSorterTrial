Name Sorter
This repository contains scripts for sorting names.

NameSorter.java -> Given a set of names, orders that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have. A
name must have at least 1 given name. (Script is still in testing phase - Was using online editor (https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler) to run NameSorter.java, Version : JDK 9.0.1), 

NameSorterTestDrive.java -> Currently has only few tests for NameSorter
