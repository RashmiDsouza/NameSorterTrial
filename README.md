Name Sorter
This repository contains scripts for sorting names.

NameSorter.java -> Given a set of names, orders that set first by last name, then by any given names the person may have. A
name must have at least 1 given name. (Script is still in testing phase)

NameSorterTestDrive.java -> Has only few tests for NameSorter
